### Environment class and objects

The class for environments is called __Environment__. It is mostly a wrapper around a dictionary,
 with the added finesse of keeping a link to the outer environment (starting a chain that goes all
 the way to the global environment and then stops) which can be traversed by the find method to 
find which innermost environment a given symbol is bound in.
