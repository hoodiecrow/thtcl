# Thtcl

A small [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
([Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)))
[interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) in [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl)
inspired by [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig)'s [Lispy](https://norvig.com/lispy.html). I've also drawn some
inspiration from '[Lisp in Small Pieces](http://books.google.com/books?id=81mFK8pqh5EC&lpg=PP1&dq=scheme%20programming%20book&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false)'
by [Christian Queinnec](https://christian.queinnec.org/).

The name Thtcl comes from Lisp + Tcl. Pronunciation '_thtickel_'. Or whatever.

To use, place the compound source files (__thtcl-level-1.tcl__ and __thtcl-level-2.tcl__)
in a directory. Start __tkcon__ and navigate to the directory. Source either __thtcl-level-1.tcl__
or __thtcl-level-2.tcl__. Use the __repl__ command to run a dialog loop with the interpreter.
